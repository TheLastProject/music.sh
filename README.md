# music.sh
music.sh is a very simple shell-based music player that shuffles your music
collection. It is not intended to handle large collections. If you wish to
handle large collections, use something like [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/)
instead.

## Setup
Copy config.sh.example to config.sh and set the values accordingly.

## Usage
Read the manpage for usage instructions.

## Dependencies
music.sh should run on any POSIX-compliant system, only requiring mplayer to
actually play the music.

## License
music.sh is licensed under the GNU GPLv3+.
